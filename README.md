## Data contents
Content
The data consists of two folders with each 1800 pictures (224x244) of the two types of moles.

## Description

Done setting up the data structures to feed images properly to the model and used pre trained model VGG16 and used its feature extraction capabilities.



## About Model

Model performed good in prediction with 84.24% validation accuracy even in 3 epocs.
